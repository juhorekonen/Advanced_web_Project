This is my Full Stack Project I made on the course: CT30A3204 Advanced Web Applications

The application Kanban lets authenticated users create columns, cards, and comments to the Kanban Board. It uses JSONWebToken to authenticate registered users during login process.

The application is built on Node.JS, Express.JS, and React. Database is handled by MongoDB.</br>
